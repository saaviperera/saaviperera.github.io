  <h1>Piston Reconstruction Experiment (P-REx)</h1>




<section>
 
  <article>
For sensitive infrared interferometry it is crucial to control the differential piston evolution 
    between the used telescopes. Whilst this has classically been done with a fringe tracker, 
    an auxiliary method known as the Piston Reconstruction Experiment (P-REx) has been developed 
    to further account for the piston drifts induced by the atmosphere over each telescope. The 
    method has previously been tested extensively in simulation and on off-line data analysis over 
    a single telescope aperture. It was found that applying the piston reconstruction in a real system 
    would reduce the piston variation from ~ 10 &mu;m down to 1 - 2 &mu;m  over timescales of up to 
    two seconds (Felix+18).  


  <br><br>
Temporal and spatial refractive index fluctuations of the atmosphere result in phase delays of different 
    parts of the wavefront, thereby inducing speckling, movement and intensity fluctuations of an image. 
    With regards to interferometry, the induced phase delays of different parts of the wavefront results 
    in unstable observed fringes, randomly moving around the sidereal position. Since interferometry is 
    reliant on accurately and precisely measuring the optical path difference between each telescope (baseline), 
    measuring and correcting for these phase delays are critical for the overall performance of the interferometer. 
 
   <br><br>   
Typically, this has been done by employing AO and fringe trackers. The fundamental need for fringe tracking 
    limits the sensitivity and sky coverage of direct interferometry in the visible and infrared wavelength 
    regime. This restriction is due to the short coherence time of the atmosphere. To overcome this problem, 
    the new algorithm P-REx can extend the integration time over the atmospheric coherence time, thus allowing 
    observations of fainter targets (Felix+18). The method has the advantage that the system can be easily 
    implemented since all required hardware will already be available at the relevant interferometers. 	

    
     <br><br>
    
The P-REx method has been presented in depth by (Felix+18), but is described here in brief for completeness. 
    The fundamental idea of P-REx is that by using POL WFS data the piston drift over a single telescope can 
    simply be calculated by taking the product of the wind velocity and the tip and tilt of the atmosphere:
    <br>
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
    &Delta; P = [tip \cdot v<sub>x</sub> + tilt \cdot v<sub>y</sub>] \cdot \Delta t \, ,
<!-- \end{equation} \label{eq:DP} -->
  <br>
    where v is the wind speed in the x and y direction, $\Delta t$ is the time over which the piston variation 
    is measured. The above equation can be used based on the following assumptions: (1) Tip/Tilt are the dominant 
    optical aberration modes of atmospheric turbulence, (2) The atmospheric turbulence profile is dominated 
    by a single layer at the ground level, (3) This single layer is driven by wind speed (<em>Taylor`s Frozen Flow</em>) 
    and (4) No boiling is present. 
     <br><br>
By obtaining $\Delta P$ at each individual aperture of an interferometer, the difference in the two piston evolution, 
    dP, can be determined for each baseline <br>
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
    dP(T) = \sum<sub>t=0</sub>^{T} &Delta; P<sub>1</sub>(t) - \sum<sub>t=0</sub>}^{T} &Delta; P<sub>2</sub>(t)  \, , <br>
<!-- \end{equation} -->
 where the subscript 1 and 2 indicates the two telescopes in a single baseline.
