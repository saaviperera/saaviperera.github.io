	<h1> Shack-Hartmann Image Motion Monitor (SHIMM) </h1>

	<h2> Optical Turbulence </h2>
Optical turbulence occurs when layers of air of different temperature mix, resulting in the aberration of
starlight propagating through the atmosphere. The atmospheric turbulence induces speckling and movement 
of the image, called <em>seeing</em>, as well as intensity fluctuations, called <em>scintillation</em>. 
    Image quality and signal-to-noise of astronomical images and photometric measurements depends on the prevailing seeing 
and scintillation conditions during an observation. The long-term statistics of the seeing are critical 
for the optimal selection of observing sites. It is important to emphasise that the altitude of turbulent 
layers, as well as their strength, affect observations in different ways. Seeing (i.e. image distortion) 
results from all turbulent layers in the atmosphere. Scintillation however, predominately results from high 
altitude turbulence. Therefore, for example, it is possible to have overall bad seeing but low scintillation 
noise. For this reason, facility turbulence monitors play an important role for astronomical observations, 
with regards to site characterisation and the optimisation and queue-scheduling of observations. 
	
	
	
	<h2> SHIMM Instrument </h2>	
One of the most commonly used seeing monitors is the Differential Image Motion Monitor (DIMM) 
    <a style="text-decoration:none"  href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1990A%26A...227..294S">(Sarazin+89)</a>. 
    The DIMM is a compact instrument, utilising a small telescope, which measures the differential motion for images 
    of the target star produced by two subapertures within the telescope pupil. The SHIMM is a variation on the DIMM design, 
    made by employing a Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (SHWFS) instead of an aperture mask <a style="text-decoration:none" 
       href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/9909/99093J/SHIMM-a-seeing-and-turbulence-monitor-for-astronomy/10.1117/12.2231680.pdf">
      (Perera+16)</a>. By using a SHWFS more subapertures can be used as shown in figure 1. <br><br	
	

	
The SHIMM  was developed to serve as a low-cost, compact, portable seeing monitor, that could be easily and 
    inexpensively duplicated, making it ideal for comparisons of atmospheric conditions around a large observing site.
    The key advantages of the SHIMM over the DIMM is that it can (1) measuring the Fried parameter (r<sub>0</sub>) 
independent of noise, (2) measure the coherence time (&tau;<sub>0</sub>) and (3) estimate a low-resolution vertical 
    profile of the turbulence.
