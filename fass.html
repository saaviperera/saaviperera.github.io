The FASS is a novel turbulence profiling technique that exploits a low noise EMCCD to image the full aperture 
    of the telescope in order to measure the atmospheric turbulence profile. This technique could replace the 
    current MASS instrument since it is not only easier to implement, but it also aims to produce higher 
    resolution turbulence profiles.

    The FASS instrument is a collaborative development between PUC, Chile 
    and Durham University, UK. The concept and analysis was developed by Andr√©s Guesalaga at PUC, and the 
    design, manufacturing and testing was completed at Durham University. 


  <br><br>
As the altitude of a turbulent layer increases the structure of the scintillation pattern in the pupil 
    image (<em>flying shadows</em> or <em>speckles</em>) changes i.e. the characteristic size of the 
    Fresnel zones associated with the layer increase. By extracting the speckle size and intensity 
    information from 2-D spatial power spectra obtained from the pupil image (Guesalaga+16). 
 
   <br><br>   
By calculating the power spectra of each linear vector, and averaging for a large number of images, 
    spectra are obtained which are used for the profile estimation. Smaller speckles will populate 
    higher spatial frequencies whereas large speckles will tend to concentrate energy at low spatial 
    frequencies. Weighting functions can be calculated assuming Kolmogorov turbulence. These can then
    be used to estimate the optical turbulence profile via a fit to the measured data. 
    
     <br><br>
    
The FASS was combined with the <a href="/shimm/">SHIMM</a>, to make the FASS-SHIMM. The FASS when conjugated 
    to the ground can not detect the ground layer turbulence. Since the SHIMM measures the 
    total integrated turbulence, the strength of the ground layer can be found by differencing 
    these measurements from the two instruments. The FASS and SHIMM are an ideal combination since 
    both instruments require the full unmasked aperture of the telescope. This is in contrast to the 
    MASS-DIMM, where aperture masks for both instruments are used.
